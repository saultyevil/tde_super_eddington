# Reprocessing in Super-Eddington Tidal Disruption Events

Provided are the parameter files, model grids, the synthetic spectra and
physical parameters of the wind, for the models shown in the paper.

In directories where `data` is included, this is the reduced atomic data
required to run the simulations. This has been included since it is not a
default atomic data set in PYTHON.

The grids have not been included themselves. Instead, the directory `remap`
contains all of the scripts and files to create the grids. Therefore the grids
for each model can be constructed by running the appropriate Python scripts.
