# The Spectral Signatures of Super-Eddington Tidal Disruption Events

Provided are the parameter files, model grids, the synthetic spectra and
physical parameters of the wind, for the models shown in the paper.

We also include some of the scripts used to generate the figures. Not all
of the scripts are included here due to them requiring data which was not
generated by ourselves, or where it is not practical to include the data in this
repository, due to, i.e., large file sizes.

The scripts may require an additional package named `pypython` to run, which
can be found at
[https://github.com/saultyevil/pypython](https://github.com/saultyevil/pypython).
Any issues with this package, please report them on the relevant GitHub page.
